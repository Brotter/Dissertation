Just things that I think of while I'm writing that I need to do or fix or whatever that I can't just put directly into the text.  It's probably easier to keep that sort of stuff here than in the notebook.

-> I need to make a really clear differentiation between proton/heavy ion extended air showers and neutrino interactions I think.  Really they big difference is the medium in which they occur, (one inside the ice sheet and one in the atmosphere).  Theres probably an extent difference (shower development length?  Sort of an xMax thing where you can specify it by transit density and then you don't have to define length?).  The interesting thing about doing this of course is that Tau neutrinos are going to be air showers after regeneration, which I also have to talk about.

-> Once I make this differentiation, I can just refer to both as showers most likely.



January 24th 2017

-> OH MY GOD I CANNOT FOCUS AT ALL.  What is wrong with me.  It is so annoying to be so easily distracted like this.

-> I need to make a schedule so i know when I need to get stuff done.  So I'm gonna do that real quick.  Lets just say I have eight chapters that I want Peter (and others) to review.  So if I did one per week for TWO MONTHS then I would be done.  That is the END OF MARCH.  I only really have four months, so lets shoot for that I guess...

-> Okay, now that I made it, i need to STICK WITH IT.  Basically it really is a chapter a week.  Lots are already filled out so this might not be the most difficult thing in the world.  Plus I have three weeks at the end for revisions, so that is a bit of a buffer.

-> FOR THIS WEEK: I need to finish the intro.  This will be good and will probably make me feel better about the whole thing.
-> ALSO FOR THIS WEEK: I need to come up with a "blinding scheme" and then finish the analysis.  I think I am closer to finishing than i think.
	->Blinding:  I need to remain blind to two things:
			1) The polarity of the signal, so basically does it match with a cosmic ray impulse or a flipped impulse
			2) The polarization of the signal?  This would also keep me blind to neutrinos which might be nice, so I'm not making cuts that throw out neutrinos because I don't expect to see any
			3) Base singlets.  Basically I shouldn't do clustering until I am done with the rest of the stuff.
			
-> It is amazing how doing a little bit of work makes me more motivated.  To bad I started at nearly 4pm :( Also I am still not super focused lol.  I need to make another doctors appointment to get more adderall because I need at least two more months to finish this dissertation.

-> Also I need to turn in that one form!!  OH NO!!  okay I sent it so whatever happens happens

-> I also "goofed" around a bit by fixing my webpage so it looks a ~little~ more presentable

-> Got some stuff done at home though :)  For tomorrow, I should, after I finish more of the chapter, print it out and see how "wrapfigure" looks like that.  


February 1st

-> Got a lot done!  Still having some problems focusing, not as bad maybe?  I keep playing Krew.io and Hordes.io which is a waste of time (B1EyjNl_g)  


-> Peter had some good notes about how to do a "blind" analysis.  Basically, we have two sort of "knobs".
1) Thermal event cuts.  Basically we can use things like Peak Interferometric Map and Peak Hilbert (coherently summed or deconvolved waveform) to cut out a huge portion of thermal events.  From there, we have signal-like events that point well (respectively to those two cuts).
2) We then can do _clustering_, since we basically have a list of things that should point to bases.  We can then look to see how well they actually DO point to bases.  We need to do this because the next cut will probably mask us to too many pseudo bases.
3) From there, we can do something like a "pattern match" cut.  This pattern match should give us a total of maybe only 30 events, which would be pointless to do clustering wUGith.  We can also maybe do some sort of polarization cut.  (geomagnetic is the primary radiation source and it will be linearly polarized around the geomagnetic field.)  Askaryan is a secondary effect.


->Also: I finished the first chapter to first order and sent it to Peter and Rick,
      . I also need to send it to -> Bob, Jelena, Gary
      . I need to set up a time for the dissertation defense.
      
      
->Also: I am teaching classes and stuff and need to make sure I know Bragg diffraction before tomorrow I guess?  And I have to make a quiz for the dude.


February 2nd
-> One more day to finish the section about the instrument.  I still have a lot of plots to make and things to shore up :(  Also I'm going camping this weekend for Dan's 30th birthday so I gotta finish the analysis stuff soon.  I am running over the full data set right now on the anita servers



February 22nd

-> Andres is talking about blinding for a template search.
	Two general categories:
		1) non base singlets (clustering)
		2) things that match a template
		
	Don't want to constrain template TOO much, we don't know what they look like necessarily from theory.  Lots of weird things can happen (LPM effect, models aren't fully evolved).  We also don't know anything about the spectrum or rates of neutrinos, so it is hard to say how often they happen and at what energy.
	
	Need to have a random factor of +/- 1 for each event at all times
	
	Abby: "We don't want more than 0.1 thermal background events."  Thermal noise cuts CHANGE what your anthropogenic background is.  You need to pick some thermal noise that you're relatively happy with, without actually being able to run the optimization of signal/sqrt(background).  In the past we've set thermal noise cut -> done clustering and seem anthropogenic numbers -> reset noise cut.  "We should probably park the thermal background more like 0.5," it is going to be higher than 0.1.
	Peter: If an event survives after you unblind is it going to be acceptable as a signal like event?  
	We need a deconvolution algorithm!  Thermal noise isn't going to both deconvolve AND point.  "After you deconvolve all that you are left with is amplitude.  We aren't enforcing phase coherence to the degree that we can eliminate thermals".
	Cosmin: We don't like any of our deconvoltions
	Andres: Other experiments do this too, and they also have a problem with it.  We "Forward Model" everything.  And you can make it parametric!  Then you get a parametric template.  
	Abby: This is when a grad student comes up and says "this is what I'm doing", referring to me, I need to do that
	
	ABCD method?
	
	Vertically polarized events aren't really as expected for neutrinos!  Amy's simulation seemed to show that we can't just require totally vertically polarized events in the neutrino channel.  A1 and A2 found these things already!  Did we accidentally exclude them?  Plane of polarization isn't a good cut!  It shouldn't increase the background at all either, oh no wait it will because the anthropogenic background estimate is based on polarization.  
	
	the Simulation team might want to actually just make a whole freaking data set instead of us injecting events into the real data (which has caused problems before).  Also this way the simulation team can blindly hand events to the analysis team, which then analyzes them and assigns polarity, and then hands them back to the simulation team to see if we got the polarity correct.
	
	Peter doesn't think that we have the instrument fidelity to actually do that though.
	
	Is it superposition or Rician addition?  Peter thinks Rician, Andres thinks that it is the same.  (Rician is a complex phasor superposition).  Maybe it didn't work because they just added the voltages together and it doesn't work.  "Data that is already realized" is a cool phrase since it doesn't have the imaginary part.
	
	Peter doesn't think we can generate a cosmic ray pulse reliably.  But we have tons!  Though the instrument impulse response is different so you have to deconvolve and deconvolve.
	
	"Extensive Air Shower"  not "Extended Air Shower".  :O  Changed in thesis
	
	Peter says that WAIS pulses and observed cosmic rays he found in ANITA3 both correlate pretty well together.  
	
	If we start getting into really low SNR cosmic rays then polarity might be an issue.  Make sure we correlate the signal arrival direction to the geomagnetic field because that is going to be be a pretty strong cut handle!  but if we blind ourselves to polarity that makes it more difficult.
	
	Andres says instead of doing thermal->template.  Do "template & geomagnetic" -> thermal.  Peter says he did "polarization and cross correlation" and then clustered them before the geomagnetic test.  
	
	We want cosmic rays right away!  Then you just need to cluster THOSE INTERESTING THINGS vs everything else.  Then you can do background estimates on the things it clusters with.  Are they anthropogenic?  Are they thermal?  Are they stupid blast crap that comes from the payload?  Are they satellite reflections? 
	Peter asks "why do it with thermals?"  He got 2000 with correlation and polarization (I wonder where he set his cut) and then he clustered and did geomagnetic.  Andres thinks that the geomagnetic is part of the template search.  
	
	How do you determine the angular error of a super low SNR event?? this is a problem for clustering thermal events.  Clustering is going to be really weird with something where the error is enormous.  Basically thermals are going to cluster with everything all the time.  

	
	
John Russel: 
	-> Transfer Function stuff
	-> Cable phase correction is riddled with mistakes.  Need to either actually calculate group delay or regenerate it by just using difference NOT BOTH.
	-> Need to prove that I'm doing the phase stuff correctly, since I was very fast and loose with it
	
My thoughts:
	Peter mentioned that "we don't control for phase" or "we dont make a cut on phase" or something like that, what is the phase SUPPOSED to look like?  I should be able to get this from the impulse response, and then a delta function should have like constant phase?  The cables too.  So then the phase should just be the filters...  Maybe this gets harder at really low SNRs though, where the noise gets worse in phase space.
	
	Also, we DO control for phase if we do a deconvolution ever.  And the correlation requires that things have the same phase.
	


Feb 24th

Okay so not a lot got done today.  Did the TA thing, tried to clean up the impulseResponse stuff but didn't really get anywhere.

Went to eat the street with Joan for dinner and had great ribs and fun

Then looked at Constantine's photogrammetry presentation (probably a plot I can use in there) and he doesn't have a good estimate of his error.  He cant really.  Its like a cm on the faces or whatever but also a scaling could be wrong or there could be a systematic and there is no cross check.  Oh well, easy section.

Linda's phase center calibration is much more interesting.  Because 1) Cosmin doesn't believe them 2) they are MUCH different from the H-pols, so physically one of them has to be incorrect, but Linda looks like she did a good job so it isn't an easy fix.  She doesn't really have uncertainty estimates, but pointing statistics look pretty good.  Something I could try, because it might be good to have a plot I made on this calibration, is using sine subtraction and plotting expected peak correlation timing offset vs measured peak correlation timing offset.  If it is systematically off, it will be seen in that distribution.  She did this, but plotted it vs incoming direction which to be honest we never use (though we should probably).  More interestingly would be to see what that is like vs time to see if it is correlated to noise or ground movement near the transmitter or something.  no that doesn't make sense, it needs to be receiver end.  so maybe some nearby coherent satellite that is time dependent or something.

Also: I gotta put together the trigTimeNs plots for the calibration pulses.  This is the section to talk about how I determined which they are.  It is a calibration after-all.

Okay, anyway I wrote up more on those sections a little.  Looks like I'm going to drive somewhere now at midnight!  I'll think about this stuff.

Feb 27th

Didn't get much done on the 25th or 26th.  A little maybe?  Wrote some stuff probably I don't know.

Today I did a lot though, mainly with the ZHAires simulations and system impulse response.  I'm super tired right now :(  I have to put together some slides for Philip about why I would be good working on GAPS, and ask Peter for a letter of rec tomorrow.  I should probably also send him some more chapters.  I have more stuff I can put in the simulation now :)  It's all under benCode/ZHAiresReader and also I installed ZHAires on this laptop for god knows what reason.  I shouldn't have to do anymore shower simulations.  I DO need to have a trigger simulation for a reason why being further away from the Cherenkov angle may still trigger ANITA3.  

I should be able to finish the calibration chapter, and I should send him the instrument chapter as well.  I also need to run the correlation alghorithm (with some basic template) on all the events.  Then I can start making cuts.  I need this by WEDNESDAY.

I'm so tired now, I can't do much else.  So tomorrow it will have to be

%%%%%%%

MARCH SIXTH

oh man.  march sixth.  that's quite far into the year.  Calibration chapter not done.  Instrument chapter needs like 3 more plots probably (from my talk with Julie).

Need to finish the parameterized cosmic ray & instrument response 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

March 16th

God it is getting close to April 1st.  Things I need to do this week:

0) Contact Szarmes and get an extension on my dissertation deadline
1) Ensure the system gain is conserved throughout the transfer function, and determine quantitative numbers for total system gain that match the link budget.
2) Put together slides about the antenna off angle gain response (which I already looked at previously), since this is required to accurately reconstruct the magnitude of the electric field
3) Determine the relative absolute phase offsets between the channels (I saw they have a ~10% distribution, so we can correct for this since it impacts pulse shape)
4) Institute an all-pass deconvolution for waveforms for the analysis, which will ideally eliminate the channel to channel variation and improve interferometric pointing as well as produce better coherent sums
5) Put together more slides about the template trigger using simulated cosmic ray E-fields and the deconvolved coherent sums.

Then today I have to go in and grade lab notebooks.  And I'm upset with Joan because I was really tired last night at midnight and woke up at like 7am this morning and she was super intent on being loud and not letting me sleep.  I got super upset because I remember that she kept saying "well if you're tired maybe you should go to bed earlier" and I CANT IF SHE IS KEEPING ME UP.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

March 22nd

Okay lets keep doing some work!  Since I last wrote I got sort of familiar with icemc, the overly complicated simulation program that I don't really understand and is a little bit of a black box.  Plus it takes like a gorillion things into account, so it isn't really duplicatable. 

But, I still need to do EVERYTHING on the list from the 16th.  I haven't done a single thing.  Me and Joan are super happy and I love her so much.  Being off this medicine is really awful, I can see why they say not to do it.  Anyway, I should probably start writing this stupid thing!  I'm gonna start with 1-3 which should go into a whitepaperish thing that I can throw into an appendix for the thesis.  People are very interested in the transfer function.

After that, I can re-write the findCosmicRays code so that it uses things like the DataSet importer class (and thus include the blinding as well) and also probably tack on a bunch to the Analyzer so that it stores more?  Anyway, first things first.

I seem incapable of writing anything :(  Maybe I should just go grade lab notebooks for awhile?  NO I HAVE TO DO THIS AAARGH.  I keep helping Jarred and the like (even though I know it is pointless).  Also my computer is almost out of batteries.  Blarf.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

April 4th (Tuesday)

Yesterday I think I got really close to finishing the absolute transfer function.  The antenna gain is ~+10dB, which matches what Ped got in 2004, and the signal chain gain is ~+61dB, which matches the link budget.

What I should do today:  Finish writing that up and put the relevant parts in my thesis.  I should also probably finish like the tables with the link budget and expected power and stuff like that.

Then, at like 3 or so, head back to the Manoa library for a few hours, then to a coffee shop I guess!


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


July 1st

Oh man it has been such a long time!  Almost two full months.  Lots happened since then.

First I came up with a cool idea that might actually be useful: I can make a coherent temperature/noise RMS map for the sky by aligning and averaging multiple waveforms with the timing offsets that correspond to that baseline.  The problem I actually need to solve is how to get the noise of a particular waveform so that I can say what the SNR (stupid measurement) is of any of the cosmic rays that I find.

Two things I told everyone I've done which are buggy at best: Average the minbias (GPS/soft trig) events over ~minute timescales per antenna to determine what the noise is in that channel without having to use the actual triggered waveform.  Found 20 cosmic rays (its such a shit non-motivated cut that I could have said any number pretty much).

Another thing I have to do is make the template result stuff into an actual class that I will then be able to pass on to others after I leave.  This is partway done, but I might even want to add things: deconvolved waveform template values.  Linearly polarized waveform (is this a thing?) waveform values.  More templates such as HI-CAL and payload blasts and maybe bases if they look the same all the time, CW.  It should make my code way cleaner if I fix this.

I also need to get icemc running in some real way, because then I can use it to do the exposure calculation.

The summer thesis deadline is a little over a month from now, so I also have to finish up the actual paper as well, or else I'm going to be shit out of luck and paying out the nose next semester.  I gotta figure out what happens with health insurance most importantly.  How wonderful that I get to devote time to that, what a great thing, capitalism is so great.  Fuck republicans.

Anyway Linda wants Trigger path responses (with no surf but maybe with the antenna?) so I should make sure that the gain isn't appreciably modified.

I also think that the unexpected added noise in ALFA is because of the shit dTs, so probably just mention that to Steph.  I'm sure someone else can take that simulation on.  Maybe she can just re-run over the lower upsample band too and see if it is better, because if I'm right it will be.

Also Patrick had a good idea of modifying the templates on a per event basis so that the phase of each off-angle antenna is correctly taken into account.  Probably not important for now, 90% correlation values seem fine especially if fixing the windowing drove it back down to 30% for noise.  The simulated data seems to show that this is a good place.

It also might be good to take another quick look at the CR off-cone fitting thing, maybe just write down the math?  I should figure out why that one was so garbage.

But in order of imporance: 
1) Fix template class so I can run stuff again
    -> oh and the filtering crap is broken and the templates aren't actually being filtered
2) Make the noise average calculator actually run as a fifo on the events while doing the full set instead of on an event by event basis
3) Make the fucking thing do decimated data again because my current balancing technique fucks that all up.
       -> This one is tricky.  Maybe fix AnitaDataset so that it can actually load multiple runs?  Or just load runs sequentially until it gets to where it needs to be then starts.  Thats probably easiest.  Then add a flag so it knows that it should do 10% of what it normally does.  I need to fix this so I can do small datasets quickly.  24 hours is still too long.
       
I'm on a plane now so that should be enough for now.


%%
July 2nd.

`cmake --build` -> figuring this out without google took me probably two hours on the plane.  Got AnitaTempalteResults as an integrated object though, so just need to add a few more

Did things with Joan and had a wonderful homecoming today.  Work related: Andres asked how many phi sectors were used to calculate the coherent sum, which made me think of the optimal number for that to maximize coherent waveform snr.  At 450MHz the 3dB point (from seavey) is about 22.5 degrees off boresight for Hpol E and H planes, or a reduction of 1/2 in signal power.  The falloff in gain steepens, and at 45 degrees, two phi sectors, it is -10dB signal power, or an order of magnitude reduction.  Now adding additional phi sectors does decrease noise, three antennas per phi.  

So is that still good?  The noise is probably incoherent so is it just more averaging that decreases the noise while summing the signal?  The problem is how do you weight the signal?  It will decrease signal power if you're averaging an off axis antenna with something you know has higher signal power, but the noise decreases too. Which wins?  Does SNR go up or down?

Simulation will tell me but math will prove it.

Okay thats for tomnorrow!  Of to bed and water for crabs!

%%
July 4th!  Forth of july!!!!


How to build stuff rom Cosmin:
cd build

[12:00] 
ccmake ../

[12:00] 
or cmake ../

[12:00] 
and then

[12:00] 
make

[12:00] 
or rm -rf build

[12:00] 
make configure


Apparently I was being dumb.

Okay I need two more classes for the noise thing.  An AnitaNoiseFactory to do all the heavy lifting (analogous to Analyzer), and an AnitaNoiseSummary to actually save it.  It looks like BenS is implementing the exact thing I did in his code so I can compare mine vs his!


Okay I think it is good now?  I made the config public in Analyzer but didn't have to.  I'll run it now :)


%%
July 5th

It still segfaults and doesn't seem to be filling the TProfile2D at all.  The rms stuff seems to work I guess.  Oh!  It never filled the TProfile because it wasn't enabled.  And it was segfaulting because I drunkenly turned on the map saving flag and it turns out that routine didn't ever work.  I figured it out though, it was trying to average maps that didn't exist because of an indexing error.

I NEED TO FINISH THE TRANSFER FUNCTION CRAP.  Its just stupid bookkeeping so I have to do it.





%%%%%%%

August 26th.

Was mostly taking notes in the notebook so look there.  Got the "M" key fixed on the new mac!  apparently it is a big process to fix it :(  So maybe I have to bring it in a lot???


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

September 6th 2017

On a plane!  Looking through CR events, direct and reflected.  I'm unblinding because I'm getting bored and I want to know if I am going to need to defend some crazy event.  I might have to just real quickly, event 15717147 looks like some crazy high energy tau neutrino.

OH MY GOD THESE FUCKING LAT/LON inversions are KILLING me.  God damn holy shit.

8:22pm HST - 11275m and a bit of turbulence (4:28 to go)
9:15pm HST - ears popped!  11274m still tho?

Direct: 27142546 and 39599205 are the only good ones really, maybe 69050312 but it is a double pulse
crab
1)  9855625  - points at LDB (12.12)
2)  9862052  - points at Scott (10.9)
3)  27142546 - Really clean, sort of close? (60)
4)  39599205 - Really clean, towards sun sort of. no bases nearby.  Best one I think
5)  69050312 - Double pulse!! nowhere close to other bases at all?  Near McM->CHC flight path, maybe a plane?
6)  78946778 - points directly at Concordia (0.25) Also looks ratty.  Again, nothing else points at Concordia besides this.
7)  80299371 - Cluster
8)  80416433 - Cluster
9)  80428168 - Cluster
10) 80434384 - Cluster
11) 80436592 - Cluster
12) 80700153 - Cluster

crab
Reflected:  Looks like 18 good ones here.  They are very weird though... not really what I expected?
1  8135326  - Pretty ratty.  Points very far down (-27), near McM.  Lots of cross pol (probably expected tho)
*2  9097075  -  Very nice.  17 down, super clean.
3  11116669 - Fav event number!  Looks nice. Points directly over a base, but way over it.  This actually might be a bug?
4  11989349 - Points towards pole, plane flight path?  also sort of sun pointed.  Looks nice tho
*5  15717147 - Waaay down, 35.  looks sorta ratty too?  Almost inverted.  Lots of CW right there too
6  16952229 - Looks nice, sort of towards sun?
*7  19459851 - Very nice!  30 down.  40 off HW angle
*8  23695286 - Closeish to a base (49). Pointing a bit low. Looks good though
*9  32907848 - Looks really good.  BenS event.
10 33484995 - Looks really good.  BenS event.
*11 41529195 - Looks really good.  BenS event. near a bunch of clustered stuff, but pointed totally opposite direction.
12 58592863 - Looks really good.  BenS event. Off cone for sure.
13 62273732 - Double (triple?) pulse.  
*14 66313844 - Another insane upcoming event (38).  looks super clean though.  crab Over ice sheet
*15 68298837 - Another insane upcoming event (36).  looks super clean though.  Over ice sheet
*16 70013898 - Very nice looking, right at horizon.  39 off HW angle
*17 73726742 - steep (27).  sort of looks like garbage?
*18 75277769 - right at sun.  Lots of these are right at the sun... looks pretty though
19 83877990 - Pointed right at Taishan base, even though it is pretty far away...  Looks so pretty :(  Nothing else really points at Taishan though, so this might be a real thing...
20 84114142 - Pointed right at Soyuz base, though super far away.  Looks like ratty garbage though. Also the geomagnetic is way off (35)
*21 84405480 - Worst looking pulse I saw in the whole set.  Doesn't point at anything though?  Also mostly Vpol.  
				Probably a neutrino lol.. HW angle off by 40 though, and geomagnetic off by 26.

* - pass more stringent base list cuts (12)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 8th 2017

So jet lagged argh.

Messed around with AntarcticaBackground, which seems nice.  Also need to start using BaseList.h since it is better

And make the covarience plots.  Probably just do it for the clustered event bases (these should be in BaseList, I don't get how John stored these things, its definitely done wrong right now), and LDB and WAIS.  Doing it for all of them looks wrong.  I think everything is WAY more correlated than I thought for signal, just not for noise.  This means the background estimate might be higher.

Also do it for linPolFrac and  linPolAngle and write write write!!  I took like two days off writing and now I'm behind.  Tomorrow is a writing day!  Then the days in wisco are too, and at the airport.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 13th

TURN ON POLARITY BLINDING!!!! THEN I CAN LOOK AT THINGS.

I need to see if our expectation matches reality for bases.  Like, if i throw a bunch of events at the continent, and look to see how close they land to bases, does that match what I see?  If it does, then the decision to not use bases is much more valid

Frequentist vs Baysian is apparently a thing, so I gotta get that right.

I should do this background estimate for things that I KNOW are background

Revisit the hardware trigger angle, is that right?
 ->  Cosmin says I should move it to 60, which is fine, it doesn't change much

Look at blast events that point at the continent. Make sure they are blasts.  Also defend the "3" cut.
 -> Yup they sure are

Make sure I'm doing statistics right, just cite the literature.  Also make sure the values went up not down.
 -> pretty sure I'm NOT doing this right

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 14th 

Drove all day, was supposed to be writing during it but didn't :(  Maybe tomorrow?

Ended up doing a bit of work at night.  Read more about Bayesian and Frequentist statistics:
Frequentist: Only takes into account the stuff you saw, and does the standard probability stuff
Bayesian:  Also takes into account other stuff you know.  Probably the correct one to use.

I am super confident my equation is wrong though.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 15th

Didn't really get much done today either, but Kathleen gave me new Beats headphones which is great!  

Wedding rehearsal dinner! 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 16th

Hung over from wedding rehearsal dinner :(  Went to a coffee shop at noon, gonna just type stuff.

Did the wais divide antenna tilt stuff.  Max to Min is only 45 degrees, not 90 like it should be, so maybe it is something else?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 17th

Figured out the Bayesian stuff I think.  Think of the bug analogy.  We see LOTS of anthropogenic crap, so we need to sort of weight that into determining how many background events we see.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 18th 

In Jersey, hard to work, did stuff in the morning at starbucks and then had the phone call at Betty's.

Notes from the meeting:
Trying to find the join probability that each event falls within a background distribution
->just make the 4d space and see how many exceed that.
	
Improve geomagnetic estimate and propogate the errors.
	
add something about unblinding polarity, how likely are we to get the polarity?
	
I need to VERY MUCH write this stuff up

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
September 19th (tuesday) -> 21st (thursday)

Tuesday: Wrote up the geomagnetic thing and propagated the errors.  two commits for this day.  Uncertainty on calculated is really low

Wednesday: Didn't have time to get stuff done before the meeting, slept in I think?  Helped Margie move her furniture around, then went to the hotel, then went to the Mason Jennings show which was super fun!  Joan got sick at night :(  Still had a great day.  No commits :(

Thursday: No time to get stuff done at all.  Hung over in the morning, went to the Hilton sales thing, went to lunch, went to The Met (which was really cool and I took some pictures) then walked back through central park and hung out with Joan all night (who is sad and scared for the plane).  Worked a bit at night, made a plot, didn't commit anything.
