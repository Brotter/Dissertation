\chapter{Results of Analysis Cuts, Candidates, Backgrounds, and Limits}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Using the methods, cuts, and a priori determined cut values described in the previous chapter, a set of final CR candidates was determined.

\section{Results of Impulsivity Analysis Cuts}
		After making the impulsivity cuts on the quality event dataset, only 5997 events remain.  This represents $1.44\times10^{-4}$ of the initial Hpol triggered dataset.  Table \ref{tab:weakCutReason} describes the number of events that failed each reduced quantity.

The cuts remove any event with a single value below those in Table \ref{tab:cutValues}.  The column marked Single is the number of events that fail that specific cut parameter if applied to all the data.  The column marked Cumulative is if each cut was taken sequentially, and the event removed if failing, before moving to the next.  The final column is the remaining number of events after each cut.}

	\subsection{Above horizon events}
		Of the events that pass the impulsivity cuts, 641 occur above the horizon and do not trace back to the continent, but are below zero elevation.  Included in this set would be CRs interacting in the atmosphere being observed directly.  These events cannot be clustered in the same way as events that land on the continent.  Since they are individual observations from a single location, there is no ability to use parallax to determine their source location depth.  Because of this, a method of temporal and pointing clustering is used to determine if they are part of the same source distribution.  This is not done until the final signal cuts are made.
		

	\subsection{Event pointing results}
		Of the 5356 events that point below the horizon, when compared against themselves, only 32 fall at least $L>40$ away from any other event in the set. This clustering result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:clusteredImpulsives}.  These events are impulsive in nature, and contain the final candidate set.

Events are only required to have one other event with $L<40$ to count as a cluster.  The Z axis shows the number of events that fall into each bin.}

		\end{figure}	
	

%	\subsection{Pseudo-base locations}
%		The locations where events do cluster can be separated into various pseudo-base locations.  These locations can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pseudoBases}.  These regions will later be used to derive the expected distributions from impulsive signal producing bases.  The extent of these cluster distributions and the areas of the continent the exclude can be used to determine the overall exposure of the instrument.

\section{Results of Signal Analysis Cuts}
		Making the final CR signal cuts on the weak event list, regardless of clustering status, yields 882 events.  873 of these project onto the continent, and 9 point above the horizon.  Of the nine that point above the horizon, 7 can be removed due to either clustering with events that fall at the horizon, temporal and true azimuth clustering.  These removed events, and the clusters they associate to, can be found in Table \ref{tab:aboveHorizonClustering}. The below horizon CR candidates can be determined by choosing events within this, and results in 18 downward pointing CR candidate events, and 2 events within the atmosphere, for 21 events total.

		Table \ref{tab:signalCutReason} describes the number of events from the impulsive set that failed each reduced quantity.  Note that interferometric map peak and map SNR do not change between the cuts, so they are not included in this table.

\section{Background Estimates}
	\label{sec:backgroundEstimate}
	Estimating the number of background events that passed all signal cuts and are present in the final candidate list is import for establishing the confidence in the final result.  The strong cut on the 

\section{Diffuse Source Frequentist Background Estimate}
	 This is accomplished using statistical inference about the probability that non-physics events would satisfy all cut requirements~\cite{ClassicalStatisticalEstimation}.  We attempt to divide the events into two sets, one background and one signal, then use the arithmetic of probability to determine the likelihood that an event from the background set could be found within the signal set.  

	In order to relate the measured data to uniform 
	
	Bayes' theorem is stated in Equation \ref{eqn:bayesTheorem}, and can be used to determine the estimate of the background.

	\begin{equation}
		P(B | S) = \frac{P(S | B) P(B)}{P(S)}
	\label{eqn:bayesTheorem}
	\end{equation}
	
	Where P(B) is the number of events in the background set
	
	
	Two different philosophies can be referenced for determining what goes into the background set.  The signal set can be defined as either the expected observation rate of UHECR particles during the flight, or as a single count for each measured candidate event individually which is then summed to find the total background probability.
	
	\subsection{Frequentist Probability}
		%I think Abby's suggested method, simply taking the ratio of impulsive events passing cuts and clustering to all clustered events regardless of impulsivity,  is Frequentist for sure, since it relies only on observed transient producing locations.  
		
		
\section{Local Frequentist Background Estimate}
	



%\section{ABCD Background Estimate}
%		The ABCD method is a common particle physics background estimator in which the ratio of background event populations within two areas of parameter space, combined with the number of events with characteristics placing it in a third, neighboring, space, can be used to derive the expected background count in a signal box region.  This expected background can then be compared versus the number of events that are actually seen to occur within that signal box.  Assuming that the distribution is constant throughout the four regions for background, and that signal only lies within the signal box, any upward deviation from the expected background count can be assumed to be the signal.
		
%		This method presents issues 
		

\section{Cosmic Ray Candidate Results}
	There were 18 events that passed all signal cuts and did not cluster to any other impulsive event on the continent, and are hereby known as the cosmic ray candidates.  Of these 18, 2 point above the horizon but still within the atmosphere, indicating that they are directly viewed EAS signals that do not reflect off the continent.  The remaining 16 point downwards and project onto the continent.  These events, their waveforms, their locations on the continent, and the distributions of nearby events  are presented in the following section.  A map summarizing the results of the analysis, including the locations of the events on the continent, along with events that cluster and events that pass impulsivity cuts but fail signal cuts, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:allEventsMap}. An overlay of measured horizontally polarized waveforms for all candidates, aligned to their peak correlation and polarity flipped relative to their estimated polarity, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hPolOverlay}.  The vertically measured waveforms have significantly less signal but are presented with alignment determined through H-Pol correlation in Figure \ref{fig:vPolOverlay}.  Additionally, the coherently summed waveforms are presented side by side in figure \ref{fig:allCandidates_coherent}.

	After setting the cuts, determining the background estimate, and compiling a list of candidate events, permission to look at the results of the polarity estimator was asked of the collaboration.  The results of the unblinding are shown in Table \ref{tab:polarityUnblinding}.

	  After unblinding the data, it was determined that 15 of the below horizon events shared the same polarity, opposite of the two above horizon events.  1 event that points below the horizon, event number 15717147, has an inverted polarity.  A plot overlaying H-pol waveforms for below horizon events, with their measured polarities, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hPolOverlay_unblinded}.  A plot overlaying the flipped polarity below horizon event with the observed above horizon events is shown in Figure \ref{fig:directEventOverlay}.
	  
	  This flipped polarity event is consistent with a directly observed EAS shower.  The measured elevation angle of the event was 35$^\circ$ below the horizontal, well below the horizon.  A directly observed EAS shower with incident particle emerging from the ice is the expected signal from a UHE$\nu_{\tau}$.  However, additional study is required to confirm this result.

		%However, I think that using the base list to compile distributions where no events passed the impulsivity cuts is more Bayesian, since it includes an assumption that known bases cause impulsive events even if we didn't observe any impulsive events from any specific base.
