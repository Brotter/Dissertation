%\section{Issues with previous analysis of ANITA2 flight data}
%	The ANITA2 flight analysis contains a time base calibration with an unexpectedly and overlooked wide dT variance.  This has the effect of limiting the response from high frequency signals, an effect not taken into account when the analysis was completed.
