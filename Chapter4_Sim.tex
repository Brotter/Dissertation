	\subsection{ZHAires Shower Modeling}
		Radio emission from cosmic ray air showers is accomplished by using the ZHS extension to the AIRshower Extended Simulations (AIRES) package.\cite{AlvarezMu√±iz2012325}  This framework, developed by Jaime Alvarez-Muniz, Washington Rodrigues de Carvalho Jr. and Enrique Zas, generates a time varient electric field for a configurable incident particle at some instrumentation point in the atmosphere.  Recent work with ANITA in mind has further extended the simulation to accurately depict reflections off the ice sheet.
		
		Simulations provide an important method to determine the overall sensitivity of the ANITA instrument to air shower events as a function of incident angle and energy and payload location.  Due to the coherent beamed characteristic of air shower radio emmission, specifically a peak at the critical Cherenkov angle from the shower axis, ANITA is only sensitive to a small fraction of showers.
		
		The spectral content of EAS radiation falls off sharply as a function of offset from the critical Cherenkov angle.  Without being within a few degrees of the peak coherence angle, low frequency radiation, below the band of the ANITA instrument, dominates the spectrum.  This can be seen in Figure figure.
